Rory
===

Rory is a base WordPress theme built off of the '_s' theme and rewritten entirely in Vue.js with absolutely no jQuery dependencies. This theme relies solely on the Vue.js framework, Bootstrap 4 grid system, and Syntactically Awesome Style Sheet (SASS) for styling. The object of this theme is to turn WordPress into a dynamic single page database drive application and to act as a Vue.js/PHP practice project for myself on a platform that I am already comfortable in.

## Libraries, Frameworks & Plugins
